// Two types of datatypes 1. primitive 2. non-primitive

// 1. primitive datatypes:- 7 types: string, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, symbol-For special define, BigInt-For large value.

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
// That means you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly. The type is determined automatically at runtime, and a variable’s type can change as the program runs. For example:
// let x = 5;      // number
// x = "hello";    // now it's a string
// In contrast, statically typed languages (like Java, C, or TypeScript) require you to define variable types at compile time, and those types cannot change.

// 2. Non-primitive also know as Refrence datatypes
// Array, objects, Functions
